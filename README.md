## 👋 hey, I'm bloodyst

i work with **Python automation** and build tools that solve real, practical problems.

mostly focused on:
- browser automation
- resilient page loading
- Telegram tools
- GUI utilities
- things that have to actually work in production

I like projects where you need to think about edge cases, retries, states, and real-world behavior — not just “happy path” scripts.

## 🛠 tech I work with
- Python
- Playwright
